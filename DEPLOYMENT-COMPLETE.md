# Real Estate ARV Calculator Deployment

The Real Estate ARV Calculator has been successfully configured and is ready for deployment. Here's a summary of what's been accomplished:

## Application Overview

The Real Estate ARV Calculator helps real estate investors analyze properties to determine their After Repair Value (ARV). Key features include:

- Property data analysis from multiple sources
- Comparable property analysis
- Renovation cost calculation
- Investment metrics including ROI and 70% rule
- Detailed reporting in Markdown and JSON formats
- AI-powered investment analysis

## Deployment Options

The application is ready to be deployed using any of the following methods:

1. **Standard Installation**: Using the included `deploy.sh` script
2. **Docker Deployment**: Using the provided Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml
3. **Manual Installation**: From the provided wheel file

## Packaging

The following deployment artifacts have been created:

- **Wheel File**: `dist/realestate_arv_app-1.0.0-py3-none-any.whl`
- **Source Distribution**: `dist/realestate_arv_app-1.0.0.tar.gz`
- **Docker Configuration**: `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml`
- **Deployment Script**: `deploy.sh`

## Installation Verification

The application has been thoroughly tested:

- Package installation tests are passing
- Command line interface works correctly
- Sample analysis runs successfully
- Report generation functions properly

## Usage Instructions

To use the deployed application:

```bash
# Run sample analysis
arv-calculator --sample

# Analyze a property
arv-calculator --address "50 Main St, New York, NY" 

# Generate a detailed report
arv-calculator --address "123 Main St, Anytown, CA" --report --output report.md
```

With Docker:
```bash
docker-compose run --rm arv-calculator --address "50 Main St, New York, NY" --report --output /reports/report.md
```

## Configuration

The application can be configured using:

1. **Environment Variables**: Set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and `ATTOM_API_KEY`
2. **Config File**: Edit `~/.arv_calculator/config.env` or mount a volume to `/config` in Docker

## Next Steps

1. **Set API Keys**: Add real API keys for Anthropic and ATTOM Data Services
2. **Test with Real Properties**: Try analyzing real properties to validate results
3. **Consider CI/CD**: Set up continuous integration for future updates
4. **Documentation**: Develop user documentation beyond the deployment guide

## Maintenance

For future updates:

1. Make code changes
2. Run tests
3. Rebuild the package: `python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel`
4. Deploy the new version
